                Every year on February 19th in Lovech, a commemorative torchlight procession is hosted in memory of Vasil Levski.

                Over three thousand people participate in the procession every year.
                'The aim is to honor the memory of Vasil Levski in his revolutionary capital in a fitting manner,' say the organizers of the event, emphasizing that with each passing year, more young enthusiasts are eager to contribute to the development of this procession.
                Over a hundred volunteers occasionally participate in organizing and securing the event.
                This is a very beautiful and emotional evening event, which is worth visiting.
