                Little is known about the development of Lovetch during the First Bulgarian Empire.
                The medieval fortress of Lovetch is known from the time of the Second Bulgarian Empire.
                It is situated on a hill, later named "Hisarya". Here, in 1187, a decisive battle took place between the rebel army of the Asen dynasty and Byzantium. 
                The signed peace treaty marked the recognition of the Second Bulgarian Empire.
                In the 14th century, Lovetch was ruled by despot Ivan Alexander of the Shishman dynasty. In 1331, Ivan Alexander was elected as Bulgarian tsar.
                 Lovetch fortress was one of the last to be conquered during the Ottoman invasion.
